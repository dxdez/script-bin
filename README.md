# Script Bin
Welcome to the script bin! This repository contains a collection of miscellaneous script files to help improve and automate various tasks or to experiment. It also includes commands and instructions for various setups such as pipelines and server functions. 

## Purpose
The intention of this repository to be used as a reference guide for a variety of tasks. These tasks can range from automation to system optimization or even setting up configurations within a server. I put this repository together so that I could have a single centralized place to reference my scripts for future use. Some but not all are also copied over to Gists. 


## Disclaimer
Please note that the scripts provided in this repository are meant to be used at the discretion of the user. While they have been created with care, it's important to understand that the scripts might need adjustments to work in your specific environment or scenario.
